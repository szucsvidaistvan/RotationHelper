RotationHelper (v1.0) - Hunter Edition
RotationHelper is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon designed specifically for Hunters to optimize their combat performance. It provides a clean, visual guide for your rotation and tracks essential buffs and debuffs in real-time.

Features
1. Smart Combat Rotation
The addon predicts the next best ability to use based on priority, cooldowns, and the target's health:

Kill Shot: Automatically prioritized when the target is below 20% health.

Serpent Sting: Tracks if the sting is active on your target.

Core Priority: Manages the cooldowns for Chimera Shot, Aimed Shot, and Arcane Shot.

Steady Shot: Suggested as a filler when all major abilities are on cooldown.

2. Status Tracking (Top Row)
A dedicated row of icons tracks your combat readiness:

Aspect Tracking: Visual indicator of your active Aspect. Glows if no Aspect is active.

Buff Monitoring: Tracks essential hunter buffs like Trueshot Aura.

Hunter's Mark: Detects if the target has Hunter's Mark applied.

Serpent Sting Timer: Displays the remaining duration and cooldown status of your sting on the current target.

3. Customization & UI
Moveable Frame: Use the /rh command to unlock the frame. A green helper box appears to let you drag the addon anywhere on your screen. Position is saved automatically.

Display Modes:

Always On: Keep the addon visible at all times.

Target or Combat: Only shows the addon when you are in a fight or have a valid enemy targeted.

Hide: Completely hides the UI.

Adjustable Prediction: Choose how many future spells (up to 4) you want to see in the rotation sequence.
